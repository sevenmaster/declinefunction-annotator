Highlight inlined C++ code in disassembly

It is useful for manual inspection `main.py` in combination with the Ghidra script `ghidra_label.py` 
and for creating datasets of inlined code `process_custom_dataset.py`.

Currently the code is rather unpolished, hacky and written along the way, while exploring how C++ STL templates are compiled.
