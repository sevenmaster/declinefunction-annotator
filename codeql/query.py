        Compile or check QL code.

        Compile one or more queries. Usually the main outcome of this command
        is that the compiled version of the query is written to a compilation
        cache where it will be found when the query is later executed.
        Other output options are mostly for debugging.

        Run a single query.

        This command runs single query against a CodeQL database or raw QL
        dataset.

        By default the result of the query will be displayed on the terminal in
        a human-friendly rendering. If you want to do
        further processing of the results, we strongly recommend using the
        --output option to write the results to a file in an
        intermediate binary format, which can then be unpacked into various
        more machine-friendly representations by CodeQL
        bqrs decode.

        If your query produces results in a form that can be interpreted as
        source-code alerts, you may find CodeQL database
        analyze a more convenient way to run it. In particular, CodeQL database
        analyze can produce output in the SARIF format, which can be used with
        an variety of alert viewers.
